Hello! this is my beta version (work in progress/ not finished) of the project "fliplist" a python3 wordlist/dictionary maker for brute force attacks.
I made this on a whim and will possibly update it sooner or later when I have time, I am only a highschool student so I will take critisim and new ways to improve my project.
Note I did take some snippets of code from other authors though only the non crucial ones since I don't want to steal works of others.
Please note I am not responsible for any or all damage caused to systems, and for illegal use of this software. USE ONLY IF AUTHORIZED OR ON YOUR SELF. Please use this responsibly.
Have FUN!
NEW PROJECT "FLIPSSH" COMING SOON - posted as of 08-16-2021 (10:14)
