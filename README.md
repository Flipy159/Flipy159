Hello! welcome to my git page, I want to introduce my self first.
I am a novice coder that learned python3 2 years ago and only known most of the basics.
I am a highschool student and wanted to post some of my random project ideas here and why not.
**I am however NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY MISUSE of my code/projects for illegal or explicit purposes, or any damage caused to the system.**
I will take constructive criticism on new methods of improving my code but I am still a novice just keep that in mind.
If you want to submit me an edited version of my code/project that may be better I would be glad to implement it into the repository.
I will be busy with school work and everything and will update my projects and code when I get free time, please be patient. 
Hope you find something interesting here!
-Flipy
