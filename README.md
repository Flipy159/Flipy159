Hello! welcome to my git page.
**I am however NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY MISUSE of my code/projects for illegal or explicit purposes, or any damage caused to the system.**
I will take constructive criticism on new methods of improving my code. If you want to submit me an edited version of my code/project that may be better I would be glad to implement it into the repository. I will be busy with school work and everything and will update my projects and code when I get free time, please be patient. 
Hope you find something interesting here!
